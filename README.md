OpenWeatherMap API ‚Äì as the public RESTful service



üíª Platform

This project is built using Java SE (Standard Edition)

Can be run on any Java-supported platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Requires Internet connection to fetch live weather data



üåç Use Cases / Applicability

Educational Projects ‚Äì Learn how to interact with REST APIs in Java

Weather Monitoring Tools ‚Äì Integrate into larger apps

Interview/Portfolio Projects ‚Äì Demonstrate API and JSON handling skills

Data Visualization Apps ‚Äì Serve as a data source for dashboards or GUIs
